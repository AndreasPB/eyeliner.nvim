# ðŸ‘€ eyeliner.nvim
Move faster with unique `f`/`F` indicators for each word on the line.
Like [quick-scope.vim](https://github.com/unblevable/quick-scope) but in Lua.

ðŸš§ **WIP: The main functionality should work, but at the current moment, the plugin is very limited in customizability.**

## Demo
In the demo, the orange letters indicate the unique letter in the word that you can jump to with `f`/`F` right away.
Blue letters indicate that there is no unique letter in the word, but you can get to it with `f`/`F` and then a repeat with `;`.
